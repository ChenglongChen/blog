# Tensor shapes in TensorFlow and dynamic batch size

Here is a simple HowTo to understand the concept of shapes in TensorFlow and hopefully avoid losing hours of debugging them

### What is a tensor?
Very briefly:
- A Tensor is an array of n-dimension containing the same type (int32, bool, etc.)
- Any tensor in general can be described with what we call a shape

A shape is a list (or tuple) of numbers describing the size of the array in each dimension, for exemple:
- For a tensor of n dimensions: **[D_0, D_1, ..., D_n-1]**
- For a tensor of size W x H (usually called a matrix): **[W, H]**
- For a tensor of size W (usually called a vector): **[W,]**
- For a simple scalar (those are equivalent): **[]** or **[1,]**

*Note on the vector: in TensorFLow it is impossible to determine if a vector is a row or column vector by looking at the shape, and in fact it doesn't matter*

Now, here is the the most important piece of this article: **Tensor in TensorFlow has 2 shapes**
- The static shape
- The dynamic shape

### The static shape
The static shape is the shape inferred by TensorFlow when you define your computational graph. 

TensorFlow will do its best to guess the shape of your different tensors (between your differnt operations) but it won't always be able to do it.
Especially if you start to make computation with placeholder defined with unkown dimension to be more dynamic (like when you want to use a dynamic batch size).

To use the static shape (Accessing/changing) in your code, you will use the different functions which are **attached to the Tensor itself and have an underscore**:
```python
my_tensor = tf.constant(0, shape=[6,2])
my_static_shape = my_tensor.get_shape() # TensorShape([Dimension(6), Dimension(2)])
print(my_static_shape) # -> (6, 2)
 # you can get it as a list too
print(my_static_shape.as_list()) # -> [6, 2]

print(tf.transpose(my_tensor).get_shape()) # -> inferred shape by tensorflow: TensorShape([Dimension(2), Dimension(6)])

my_tensor.set_shape([d_0, ...]) # It is used mostly to ensure you have a precise shape
```

*The static shape is very useful to debug your code with `print` so you can check your tensors have the rights shape.*

### The dynamic shape
The dynamic shape is the actual one used when you compute things: when you `run` your graph.

If you defined a placeholder with undefined dimensions (with `None`), those `None` dimensions will only have a value when you feed an input to your placeholder and, more importantly, for any variable depending on this placeholder.

To use the dynamic shape(Accessing/changing) in your code, you will use the different functions which are **attached to the main scope and don't have an underscore**:
```python
my_tensor = tf.constant(0, shape=[6,2]) # <tf.Tensor 'Const_4:0' shape=(5, 2) dtype=int32>
my_dynamic_shape = tf.shape(my_tensor) # <tf.Tensor 'Shape:0' shape=(2,) dtype=int32>
# The shape is (2,) because my_tensor is a 2-D tensor, so the dynamic shape is a 1-D tensor containing size of my_tensor dimensions

my_reshaped_tensor = tf.reshape(my_tensor, [2, 3, 2]) # <tf.Tensor 'Reshape_2:0' shape=(2, 3, 2) dtype=int32>

# To access a dynamic shape value, you need to run your graph and feed any placeholder that your tensor my depended upon:
print(my_dynamic_shape.eval(session=tf.Session(), feed_dict={...}))
```

*The dynamic shape is very handy for dealing with dimensions that you want to keep dynamic*

## The RNN use case
So here we are, interested in dynamic inputs we want to build a RNN which should be able to handle any different length of lists

In the training phase will we defined a placeholder with a dynamic batch_size, for example:
```python
my_placeholder = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, seq_max_length])
```

Then we use the TensorFlow API to create a LSTM:
```python
cell = tf.nn.rnn_cell.LSTMCell(num_units=50, state_is_tuple=True)

init_state = cell.zero_state(batch_size=???, tf.float32)
outputs, encoder_final_state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell, rnn_inputs, initial_state=init_state)
```
And now you need to initialize the init_state cell `cell.zero_state(batch_size, tf.float32)` ...

But what the batch_size input should be equal to ? Remember you want it to be dynamic.
TensorFlow allows different types here, if you read teh source code you will find:
```python
Args:
      batch_size: int, float, or unit Tensor representing the batch size.
```
int and float can't be used because when you defined your graph, you actually don't know what the batch_size will be.

The interesting piece is the last type: **"unit Tensor representing the batch size"**

If you dig the doc up from there, you will find that a unit Tensor is a **0-d Tensor** which is a **Scalar**

So how do you get that scalar-tensor anyway? Let's see:
If you try:
```python
batch_size = my_tensor.get_shape()[0]
```
`batch_size` will be the `None` type, The `None` type can only be used as a dimension for placeholders.

If you try:
```python
batch_size = my_tensor.get_shape().as_list()[0]
```
`batch_size` will be the TensorFlow `Dimension(None)` type (printed as '?'). Surprisingly, you still won't always be able to use that either.

What you want to do is actually to keep the dynamic `batch_size` flow though the graph, so you must use the dynamic shape:
```python
batch_size = tf.shape(my_tensor)[0]
```
`batch_size` will be a TensorFlow `0-d Tensor` type describing the bach dimension, hooray!

## Conclusion
- Use the static shape for debugging
- Use the dynamic shape everywhere especially when you have undefined dimension

*Addendum: Tensorflow is taking care of the init_state for me and initiliaze it to the zero_state, why would i need to manually define it this way?*

You might want to initialize your init_state to something different than the zero_state, and now you can do it, because when you run a graph, you can actually use the feed_dict to feed any variable at hand in your graph!

```python
sess.run(encoder_final_state, feed_dict={
  init_state: previous_encoder_final_state
})
```
**Cheers!** :beer:
